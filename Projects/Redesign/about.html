            <p class="blog-post-meta">January 1, 2014 by <a href="#">Mark</a></p>

            <p>Mary Sutherland is an author and researcher focusing her work 
on consciousness studies, ancient history and unusual 
phenomena. She is a "hands on" researcher and the creator of 
one of the largest website on the internet with hundreds of 
pages providing information on the paranormal, UFOs, ancient 
races and their cultures, sacred sites and power points of the 
world, underground tunnels and cave systems, dimensional 
worlds , metaphysics, etc. The governor of Kentucky 
commissioned her as a ‘Kentucky Colonel” for her work on the 
ancient sites of Kentucky. For the last 5 years, she has been 
exploring, mapping and documenting the ancient underwater 
structures of Rock Lake – near Aztalan. For the last fourteen 
years she has been documenting the ancient sites around 
Burlington, WI. Truth is her passion. She believes it is through 
truth that we will break ourselves free of our present 
entanglements in life. When we become free, we will create our 
own ‘personal story’ of the ‘hero’s journey’ suggested by Joseph 
Campbell.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>“There are rare persons in this world who see things others 
don’t; persons who connect the dots of existence and 
possess an instinctive talent for linking with kindred souls to 
reveal otherwise invisible patterns and excavate hidden 
truths. Such a person is Mary Sutherland. She is a natural-
born networker in all she does --- from her Burlington 
Vortex Conferences and Sci’Fi Café to her public talks and 
published books. Nowhere, however, is her gift for 
perception more developed than in her latest title.“  Frank 
Joseph .
Joseph was nominated by Japan's Savant Society as 
Professor of World Archaeology. He was editor-in-chief of 
Ancient American Magazine from 1993 to 2007 and has 
traveled the world collecting research materials for his 
twenty-seven published books.</p>
            <hr>
              <p><blockquote>"Mary Sutherland is not simply a reporter of all these phenomena; 
she lives them! As readers expect, her studies extend beyond her 
own experiences. The author and investigator often takes visitors 
on tours containing an inter-dimensional vortex and hosts yearly 
conferences and meet ups with many well known speakers on 
anomalous phenomena."</blockquote>
What differentiates her book. Haunted Burlington Wisconsin , is that 
Sutherland includes her explanations of the unknown realms and 
phenomena with tips for heightening the reader's own psychic 
awareness. Readers who complete this dizzying journey may find 
they can no longer look at Burlington in exactly the same way. 
Perhaps, then, this book itself may be considered a vortex. and 
whether or not it actually transports you to another place, it will 
certainly draw you in."
Linda Godfrey , award winning author on strange creatures, people 
and places. She has been featured guest on dozens of nation TV 
and radio shows, including Monsterquest, Sean Hannity's America, 
Lost Tapes, Inside Edition, Sy-fy's Haunted Highway, Monsters and 
Mysteries, Coast to Coast...and the list goes on!</p>
